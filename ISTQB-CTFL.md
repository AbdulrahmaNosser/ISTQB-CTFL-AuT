### 4.3.1 Statement Testing and Coverage
Statement testing exercises the potential executable statements in the code.
### 4.3.2 Decision Testing and Coverage
Decision testing exercises the decisions in the code and tests the code that is executed based on the decision outcomes.
### 4.3.3 The Value of Statement and Decision Testing
Achieving 100% decision coverage guarantees 100% statement coverage (but not vice versa).
