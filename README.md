# ISTQB-CTFL-AuT
## Introduction
This is a summary of ISTQB-CTFL-AuT syllabus version 2.0.2.
I wrote it during my preparation period for the exam. I suggest reading the whole syllabus first or going through a playlist that explains the content then using this as a review. This is based on the learning objectives that are covered in the exam and is not a substitute for the original document. I recommend going through the syllabus in full and then referring to this document as a review.
The **ISTQB-CTFL** file is incomplete and was just put in to fill on some prerequisite knowledge needed for **ISTQB-CTFL-AuT**. There are no plans to summerise them till now. I have an old highlighted PDF file for **ISTQB-CTFL** for version v3.1.1 and for **CTFL-AT** version 1.0. You can find these files along with **ISTQB-CTFL-AuT** [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tsMVKe71jvPGmS9LqJIdaGfR0y1NQ-_2?usp=sharing).
## How to view
For a better reading experience rendering the callouts and reference linking I suggest viewing this on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download). You need to view **ISTQB-CTFL-AuT** only as the other files are linked to it with context.

Please let me know if there are any mistakes that I should correct. I hope that you will find this helpful. I wish you all the best in your exam.
